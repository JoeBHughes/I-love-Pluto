			<h1>History</h1>
			
			<p>Pluto has a unique and storied history among the nine planets in the Solar System. Here are some of its more interesting features:</p>
			
			<section id="discovery">
				<h1>Discovery</h1>
<p>In the <time>1840s</time>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbain_Le_Verrier" title="Urbain Le Verrier">Urbain Le Verrier</a> used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics">Newtonian mechanics</a> to predict the position of the then-undiscovered planet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune">Neptune</a> after analysing perturbations in the orbit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus">Uranus</a>. Subsequent observations of Neptune in the late 19th century led astronomers to speculate that Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides Neptune.

<p>In <time datetime="1906">1906</time>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percival_Lowell">Percival Lowell</a> &ndash; a wealthy Bostonian who had founded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Observatory">Lowell Observatory</a> in Flagstaff, Arizona, in <time datetime="1894">1894</time> &ndash; started an extensive project in search of a possible ninth planet, which he termed "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planets_beyond_Neptune">Planet X</a>". By <time datetime="1909">1909</time>, Lowell and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Pickering">William H. Pickering</a> had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet. Lowell and his observatory conducted his search until his death in <time datetime="1916">1916</time>, but to no avail. Unknown to Lowell, his surveys had captured two faint images of Pluto on <time datetime="1915-03-19">March 19</time> and <time datetime="1915-04-07">April 7, 1915</time>, but they were not recognized for what they were. There are fourteen other known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precovery">prediscovery</a> observations, with the oldest made by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkes_Observatory">Yerkes Observatory</a> on <time datetime="1909-08-20">August 20, 1909</time>.</p>

<p>Percival's widow, Constance Lowell, entered into a ten-year legal battle with the Lowell Observatory over her late husband's legacy, and the search for Planet X did not resume until <time datetime="1929">1929</time>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesto_Slipher">Vesto Melvin Slipher</a>Vesto Melvin Slipher, the observatory director, summarily handed the job of locating Planet X to 23-year-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Tombaugh">Clyde Tombaugh</a>, who had just arrived at the Lowell Observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings.</p>

<p>Tombaugh's task was to systematically image the night sky in pairs of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position. Using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_comparator">blink comparator</a>, he rapidly shifted back and forth between views of each of the plates to create the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates taken on January 23 and 29 of that year. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 helped confirm the movement. After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College_Observatory">Harvard College Observatory</a> on <time datetime="1930-03-13">March 13, 1930</time>.</p>

            <section id="name">
                <h1>Name</h1>
<p>The discovery made headlines around the globe. The Lowell Observatory, which had the right to name the new object, received more than 1,000 suggestions from all over the world, ranging from Atlas to Zymal. Tombaugh urged Slipher to suggest a name for the new object quickly before someone else did. Constance Lowell proposed Zeus, then Percival and finally Constance. These suggestions were disregarded.</p>
                
<p>The name Pluto, after the god of the underworld, was proposed by Venetia Burney (1918–2009), a then eleven-year-old schoolgirl in Oxford, England, who was interested in classical mythology. She suggested it in a conversation with her grandfather Falconer Madan, a former librarian at the University of Oxford's Bodleian Library, who passed the name to astronomy professor Herbert Hall Turner, who cabled it to colleagues in the United States.</p>
                
<p>The object was officially named on May 25, 1930. Each member of the Lowell Observatory was allowed to vote on a short-list of three: Minerva (which was already the name for an asteroid), Cronus (which had lost reputation through being proposed by the unpopular astronomer Thomas Jefferson Jackson See), and Pluto. Pluto received every vote. The name was announced on May 1, 1930. Upon the announcement, Madan gave Venetia £5 (equivalent to 300 GBP, or 450 USD in 2014) as a reward.</p>
                
<p>The final choice of name was helped in part by the fact that the first two letters of Pluto are the initials of Percival Lowell. Pluto's astronomical symbol (<img src="images/Pluto_symbol.jpg" alt="pluto_symbol" width="20" height="20">, Unicode U+2647, ♇) was then created as a monogram constructed from the letters "PL".</p>
