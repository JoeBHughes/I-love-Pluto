<p>Due to Pluto's distance from Earth, in-depth study from Earth is challenging. On July 14, 2015, NASA's New Horizons space probe flew through the Pluto system, and the 50 gigabits (or 6.25 gigabytes) of information it gathered was transmitted to Earth. The final data transmission was October 25, 2016 at 05:48 pm ET.</p>
            
<h2>Surface</h2>
<p>Pluto's surface is composed of more than 98 percent nitrogen ice, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide.[105] Nitrogen and carbon monoxide are most abundant on the anti-Charon face of Pluto (around 180° longitude, where Tombaugh Regio's western lobe, Sputnik Planitia, is located), whereas methane is most abundant near 300° east.[106] Pluto's surface is quite varied, with large differences in both brightness and color.[107] Pluto is one of the most contrastive bodies in the Solar System, with as much contrast as Saturn's moon Iapetus.[108] The color varies between charcoal black, dark orange and white.[109] Pluto's color is more similar to that of Io with slightly more orange, significantly less red than Mars.[110] Notable geographical features include Tombaugh Regio, or the "Heart" (a large bright area on the side opposite Charon), Cthulhu Regio, or the "Whale" (a large dark area on the trailing hemisphere), and the "Brass Knuckles" (a series of equatorial dark areas on the leading hemisphere). Sputnik Planitia, the western lobe of the "Heart", is a 1000 km-wide basin of frozen nitrogen and carbon monoxide ices, divided into polygonal cells which are interpreted as convection cells that carry floating blocks of water ice crust and sublimation pits towards their margins;[111][112][113] there are obvious signs of glacial flows both into and out of the basin.[114][115] It has no craters that were visible to New Horizons, indicating that its surface is less than 10 million years old.[116] The New Horizons science team summarized initial findings as "Pluto displays a surprisingly wide variety of geological landforms, including those resulting from glaciological and surface–atmosphere interactions as well as impact, tectonic, possible cryovolcanic, and mass-wasting processes."</p>
 
<h2>Internal Structure</h2>
<p>Pluto's density is 1.860±0.013 g/cm3.[4] Because the decay of radioactive elements would eventually heat the ices enough for the rock to separate from them, scientists expect that Pluto's internal structure is differentiated, with the rocky material having settled into a dense core surrounded by a mantle of water ice. The diameter of the core is hypothesized to be approximately 1700 km, 70% of Pluto's diameter.[117] It is possible that such heating continues today, creating a subsurface ocean of liquid water some 100 to 180 km thick at the core–mantle boundary.[117][118] In September 2016, scientists at Brown University simulated the impact believed to have formed Sputnik Planitia, and showed that it may have been the result of liquid water upwelling from below after the collision, implying the existence of a subsurface ocean at least 100 km deep.</p>
